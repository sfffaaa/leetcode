This project helps me to find the next problem solving in leetcode website.

The code uses chrome cookie for crawl the problem solved right now and composes to
the problem set with frequency in order to find the next problem. So callee must login
leetcode from chrome.

And this project has two spec for using easily.
1. Level focusing
	In leetcode, there are three levels, easy, medium and hard. So callee can change the
	parameter for focusing the level they want to practice.
2. Uninterested Problem skipping
	Callee can skip their uninterested problem even the problem has high frequency. It helps
	me to skip SQL related problem.
